Project Name: GeoLogix Refund By Location

Description:

GeoLogix Refund By Location is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain to automate reward systems for drivers based on geographical compliance. The project aims to enhance logistics operations by ensuring timely deliveries within designated zones. It leverages smart contracts and GPS data to facilitate automatic payments to drivers adhering to specified geographic zones, with penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, an ERC20 token-based rewards system incentivizes driver compliance and enhances overall performance.
